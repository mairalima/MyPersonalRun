Continuing my learning journey, I decided to bring together two passions: technology and running.
I'm building MyPersonalRun, an Android app made for people like me — who love to train and want to keep both training plans and activity history all in one place.
📲 The app already integrates with the Strava API, pulling real data from running, cycling, weight training, and swimming.
 ✅ OAuth 2.0 authentication is fully implemented
 ✅ Activity list is working and pulling live data

🔧 In progress:
Custom training plan screen
AI integration to dynamically adjust training plans based on user performance — suggesting changes to avoid injuries or boost results
Progress charts with MPAndroidChart
Local storage using Room Database
⚙️ Tech stack: Kotlin, Android Studio, Material Design 3, REST API
💡 The goal is simple: track my athletic evolution my way — with focus, performance, and a clean, minimal UI.
